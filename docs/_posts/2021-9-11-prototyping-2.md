Focused on conceptualizing/visualizing the installation space to accompany the EEG headband.

I wonder whether a "mirror maze" type of room would somehow affect brain activity by evoking confusion or concentration. Using 3D visualization, I played around with reflections and discovered several properties/techniques that could be used to help make the installation more "trippy." These techniques include:

- Facing mirrors opposite one another for an "infinite subject" effect.
- Angling sets of mirrors such that each mirror reflects onto another but not vice versa. This allows for multiple mirrors to show drastically different angles/perspectives.
- Facing lights towards walls rather than towards the center/subject. Having the light bounce off of the reflections creates interesting visual effects, somewhat similar to generative art.
- Tinting/cracking mirrors for visual distortion.

My main issue with this idea is that it would be prohibitively expensive; cursory research has yielded that each mirror could potentially cost upwards of $100. Nevertheless, the idea has potential if I can find a way to reduce material costs.
