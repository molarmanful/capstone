I continued learning and playing around with TouchDesigner, this time transitioning from 2D to 3D. This is where TouchDesigner truly outshines Processing and OpenFrameworks for me; the block-based drag-and-drop interaction that TouchDesigner uses made it much easier to visualize and work in 3D.

Using noise, image filters, and instancing to generate dynamic abstract 3D sculptures. Again, many parameters available for potential reaction to brain activity.

Another noise-based approach with different image filters and some post-processing (depth-of-field and subtle background gradient).
