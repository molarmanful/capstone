## Goal/Idea

To hack/repurpose a toy EEG headband for applications in generative/installation art.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a typically non-invasive way to measure the brain's overall electrical activity. Within the past decade, EEG technologies have made their way onto the consumer market as meditation monitoring tools and brain-training games. This has given tinkerers relatively cheap and reliable access to brain data. Toy EEG headbands like the ones found in [Mindflex](https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-P2639-Mindflex-Game/dp/B001UEUHCG) are able to be [rewired with Arduino](http://www.frontiernerds.com/brain-hack). By plugging the Arduino-headband rig into the computer, one may send the headband's realtime readings via serial bus into software like OpenFrameworks or Processing.

## Safety Precautions

Since I am dealing with electricity in extreme proximity to the brain, extra caution is necessary - especially when handling the Arduino-headband rig. During use, the Arduino may only draw power from the laptop; **no wall power allowed**.
