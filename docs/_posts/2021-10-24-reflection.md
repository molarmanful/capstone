Currently, much of my work on the capstone so far has been in concept design and prototyping.

Since I currently don't have access to any IM lab equipment or resources, I have bought an Arduino kit and soldering iron to get started on basic prototyping. I also found a Mindflex headband to tinker with and figure out the process of repurposing it for reading brain activity. Documented below is my process of wiring the Arduino to the headband circuitry.

Unfortunately, this prototype failed to work because the battery compartment was defective. I am waiting for another Mindflex headband to arrive in the mail so I can make a second prototype that (hopefully) works.
