I have moved back to NYUAD campus, but progress on the hardware side of the project is currently halted until I obtain access to the lab spaces. I am experimenting with visual backends, choosing between Processing, OpenFrameworks, TouchDesigner, and VVVV. Other than that, most of the progress right now is being made in designing and prototyping the visuals.
